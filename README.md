# Jetpack Compose Wikipedia Clone

Hello everyone 🙋🏻‍♂️</br></br>
I made a wikipedia clone application called using wikipedia api with jetpack compose that I have been working on for a long time.</br>
In this application where I try to use the latest technologies, I will be sharing the github link for you,</br>
The app is huge and every step is carefully written, I will edit and update it in case errors appear 🙂
</br></br>
You can review it from the github readme link, where I used videos and images to explain briefly.
</br></br>
We must be better than we were yesterday 😉
</br></br>
I hope it will be useful, good work everyone.

* Move the picture in 3D with two fingers.

* Using flow with Jetpack Compose.s
* Notify users about buttons.
* Focus on specific areas and inform about those areas.
* Using LazyColumn and RowColumn.
* Instant listening and request throwing.
* Use of Slider-Pager.
* Use of shimmer.
* Get attention with the scrolling text feature.
* Receive and use color codes via API.
* I created a fake view thanks to AndroidView without using XML, and I was able to use the Balloon feature, which normally works in XML.
